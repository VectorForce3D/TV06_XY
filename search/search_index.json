Originally developed as a branch of the ProosaXY, the TV06 has taken on a fully unique form now as it moves into the Beta testing stage. The goal of the machine is simple; 10k acceleration and 250mm/s print speeds at quality.</p> <p></p> <p>The TV06 was designed by Dustmuffins and Ghoste of the TV06 Discord Server. We welcome all to our community and invite you to join our wonderful community!.</p> Irreversible Alterations <p>The TV06 Project seeks to integrate numerous components from the original SV06 machine line, but certain compromises are unavoidable. Specifically, some elements, such as rods and leadscrews, will be cut during the modification process. The frame predominantly consists of new metal, and proficiency in using a metal saw is essential. If you lack experience in operating a metal saw, please reach out to our help-desk channel on Discord, and someone will help you out.</p>"},{"location":"#a-thank-you-to-our-predecessor","title":"A thank you to our predecessor","text":"<p>The TV06 project would not be where it is today without the initial time investments of the ProosaXY.

We are aware that old habits die hard and the Voron print specification is also acceptable, however we recommend trying ours as all parts were tested with these settings and not Voron specifications. Standard strength denotes 2-3 walls at standard line widths and enough tops, bottoms, and infill to not have any holes or pillowing. </p>"},{"location":"about/#material-choice","title":"Material Choice","text":"<p>We can not stress this enough; ASA is the material of choice for this machine. ABS is also just as acceptable however we have found ASA to be easier to print than ABS. Polymaker makes incredible ASA that has served us well across the duration of this project. Slightly pricier than others, it is absolutely worth the quality. If you are looking for a sightly more budget oriented option, flashforge makes decent ASA as well.</p> Do NOT Cut Corners <p>The above information is all to be followed to the letter. Do not risk damage to machine, property, or personal injury because you wanted to save a relatively insignificant amount of money by purchasing PLA, PETG, or not printing the parts at proper strength settings. Additionally, do not purchase white ASA or ABS from any brand. The pigment contains titanium dioxide which is known to weaken plastics noticeably. In conjunction with this, avoid eSun ABS+ for similar reasons. These will all come back to haunt you down the road and will significantly impact the longevity and performance of your machine.</p> <p>It is not worth the risk.</p>"},{"location":"sourcing/","title":"Sourcing Guide","text":""},{"location":"sourcing/#its-alive","title":"It's Alive!","text":"<p>This sourcing guide is a living, breathing document and should be viewed as such.
